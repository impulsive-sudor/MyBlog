# How to Deploy?

## Current Tool
The blog tool I'm using is called `Hugo`. I don't have much experience with it but I'm fan a fan of it's ability to easily translate markdown to HTML. Using Markdown is more universal and can be carried over to other platforms easily. 

## Git
To start, I want to use some kind of Git server to store and deploy my code. I'm not sure if it matters that this platform is private or public. 

## S3 Directly?
I have a few years of AWS experience, so I'm most likely going to put this in AWS. Since this is going to be a static site, the costs should be minimal. I could deploy this site directly to a S3 bucket but I'd rather use CI/CD to deploy.
