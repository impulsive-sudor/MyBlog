## Summary
I'm dreaming up a day where I have nearly full control of my data. I like the peace of mind of having all my data protected by a level that works for me. If I want to expose more data, I have the choice too. Building my cloud should be a learning experience and something I can carry over to work. 

## Requirements
1. The solution has to work in a production environment
2. Maintenance must be minimal, I don't need a job away from a job
3. Cost efficent is must!
4. Easily repeatable

## Software to replace
- **Password Manager:** Currently using 1Password and Apple Keychain
- **Photos**: Mostly Apple Photos
- **File Storage:** Onedrive and Icloud
- **Office:** Microsoft Word and Apple pages
- **Media:** Apple TV, Netflix, Disney, Apple Music, etc

## Software to Add
- 24/7 Bedrock [Minecraft server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock)
- Recipe Application ([Mealie](https://mealie.io))
- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)

## Nice to have
- A gaming system that I can remotely access from anywhere.
