As of January 21st, 2024, there is a bug when connecting to PalWorld servers with a password. Basically, there's no prompt to enter when you connect to the server by IP/Hostname.

>Check if the server is in your recent server list, just connect from there instead of the manual connect option. This will prompt you for a password.

**To workaround this bug, do the following:**

1. Go to the Community Servers tab with in the Multiplayer dashboard
2. Find any server that is password protected and connect to it
