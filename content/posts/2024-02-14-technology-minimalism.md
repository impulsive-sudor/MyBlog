One day, I aspire to streamline my technology stack. I'm not advocating for a single option, but rather, a comprehensive product that fulfills all my personal and family needs. I also yearn for simplicity in other aspects of my technological life, such as networking. Currently, I juggle multiple password managers, email services (with custom domains), open-source routers, and more.

## Goals

* Unified Login
* Synergy Among Apps
* Privacy
* Security (End-to-End Encryption)
* Family Sharing Features
* Flexibility
* Seamless Integration of Work and Personal Life

## Compromises

I'm prepared to invest upfront effort to ensure the long-term functionality of the product. What does this mean? I'm willing to set up my own server, configure backend settings, and even pay a bit extra if necessary.

## Why?

You might ask, "Why bother?" The answer lies in the busyness of my life. The more time I spend on tasks like organizing my calendar, managing my documents, remembering random passwords, assisting my family with tech issues, and managing finances, the less time I have for things that truly matter. I want my tools to work efficiently so I can focus more on developing my next application, spending time with family, going on a vacation, or pursuing other interests.
